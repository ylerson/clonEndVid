What’s more casual: “Let me take your coat,” or “Allow me to take your coat”? Find out in the lesson and learn other common offer phrases, such as: “Would you like,” “Would you like me to,” “Have some,” “May I,” “Shall I,” “Can I get you,” “Do you want,” and “Take one.” Boost or reinforce your understanding of formal and casual English, then do the quiz to test what you have learned.

For example, when we say, “Whoever did this is a genius”, we mean that we don’t know who it is, but it doesn’t matter because no matter who it is, that person is a genius. It is a broader statement than just answering the question “Who did this?” We can also use the W5 words as exclamations. “Whatever!” is a good example of an exclamation that expresses indifference or dismissal.

In this lesson, we will focus on the prepositions off, on, over, and up to form our phrasal verbs. Native English speakers like to use phrasal verbs because they contain the same amount of information as a long phrase does but in a small recognizable word pattern. For example, we can replace the phrase “research information online about something” with look up. You can also replace “contact someone to give them information” with follow up. So much more simple, right? Watch the lesson to find out what other phrasal verbs you can form with these prepositions. They will be useful to you in business and in everyday life.",

    "description": "Do you have trouble pronouncing s words in English? Many students find words like “street”, “squirrel”, “screen”, “spell”, “snow”, and others difficult to pronounce. That’s because these words have consonant clusters in them. Consonant clusters are two or more consonants next to each other in a word. In this video, we will focus on s words that contain consonant clusters, like the “str” in “street” or the “sk” in “sky”. In English, consonant clusters are very common. There may not be any in your native language, which could make their pronunciation challenging for you. But by the end of this video, you will have a solid grasp of the concept of consonant clusters and their pronunciation.",

In this lesson, I’ll talk about exceptions with comparatives and superlatives in English. A comparative word compares two things by adding an -er ending. For example, we change ‘short’ to ‘shorter’ to make a comparative word. A superlative word is one whose quality, whether good or bad, surpasses all others. For example, we change “cute” to “cutest” to show that it is number one of its kind. As you can see, all you have to do to get the superlative is add -est to the root word. But, my friends, this is English, and there are exceptions. That’s where this lesson comes in. I will teach you superlative and comparative words that are exceptions to the rule, like “worst”, “best”, “most”, “least”, “farthest”, “more”, “less”, “worse”, and “better”. These are common words that most people use every day, so it’s important to understand them and to say them correctly.",

These questions and more will be answered when you watch this English grammar lesson on auxiliary verbs. I will teach you how to use the three auxiliary verbs in English – be, do, and have. We will go over each one in detail and with examples. First, you will learn how to use be in the passive and progressive forms in the present, past, and future. Then, we will look at do in the present and past simple. Last, I will teach you how to use have in the future, present, and past perfect. Plus, we will discuss the positive and negative use of do as an auxiliary verb”. Whew! There’s a lot of material here, so make sure you do the quiz at the end to test your understanding.",

Well, that’s why I’m here! Sex is a wonderful thing, but it is VERY important that you are educated on how to protect yourself and your partners. I’ll talk about different types of birth control, like condoms, IUDs, and the pill, as well as the importance of getting tested so that your sex life can be happy and healthy. You’ll also learn about some common sexually transmitted diseases, and the slang terms that native English speakers use to talk about them. Have sex, be safe, have fun, and have more sex.

I’ve visited South Asia many times in my life, and there are many South Asians living in London, so I’ve had a whole lifetime to listen to South Asian English. Many South Asians speak very, very good English, but some aspects of the way they speak English are confusing or considered incorrect in British English. Watch this video to learn what these issues are, so that you can correct them today. My tips for South Asian English speakers cover grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and tone. For example, if you change your intonation in a sentence by putting the stress on a different word, it may be perceived to have a different meaning. But the word you put the stress on in India may be different from the one you should put the stress on in England! Also, South Asian and British English speakers sometimes have different meanings for common words like “hotel” and “backside”. Even if you are not South Asian, this lesson will help you with your English pronunciation.",

Even people who have been learning English for many years and who have huge vocabularies and great grammar, still find it difficult to know when to use each preposition.

Take the quiz to see if you have learned the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of these words!",

In fact, the majority of people do not follow all the grammar rules that you learn on engVid or in textbooks.\n\nIt is sometimes confusing for learners of English when they hear their native speaker friends making these mistakes. They are also often heard in movies. There is a big cultural divide between people who speak correct English and people who speak with mistakes. The ability to speak English in the grammatically standard way will often determine whether you have access to a professional-level job. This is especially true if you’re a non-native speaker of English, so I strongly suggest you follow the standard rules of English grammar.
