    "description": "This lesson is all about English expressions that come from mixed martial arts and combat sports! But don‚Äôt assume all of the expressions I will teach you have to do with actual fighting. Rather, we use these expressions in everyday conversation when we talk about competition, challenges, and arguments. For example, when we say throw your hat in the ring, we are not talking about a boxing ring, but someone entering a competition or challenge. When we say take it on the chin, we are not talking about punches. It means to accept defeat without complaining. So as you can see, although some expressions come from the world of combat sports, they are commonly used in non-violent situations. Some other expressions we will look at include: spoiling for a fight, the gloves are off, fight tooth and nail, uphill battle, throw in the towel, win hands down, and more. So before you tap out, click the lesson, and do the quiz to test yourself.",

    "description": "A surprising thing about British town names is they are often pronounced differently than they are written. For example, the name ‚ÄúTottenham‚Äù is actually pronounced phonetically like ‚Äútot-nam‚Äù, which is only two syllables compared to the three syllables in its written form. Depending on where you are in Britain, you may even hear different variations in pronunciation. So how can you know how to pronounce town names properly? In this lesson, I will teach you about common suffixes of British town and city names and how to pronounce them correctly every time. I will teach you the etymology of suffixes such as -ham, -bury, -field, -wich, -mouth, -pool, and -ing. We will also talk about what these suffixes mean. For example, did you know that any town name that ends in -pool means ‚Äúharbour‚Äù? Learning these suffixes will improve your pronunciation and knowledge of British town names.",

    "description": "In this lesson I‚Äôll teach you FAST native speaker pronunciation. We‚Äôll look at how when native speakers are relaxed and talking fast, individual sounds in a sentence may change completely. This happens because our tongues naturally want to say everything the laziest way possible! I‚Äôll give you plenty of examples of the sounds in words changing when spoken quickly and I‚Äôll also teach you some IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). We‚Äôll also practice speaking with the right intonation when asking questions, as this is really important not only to convey the right meaning, but also to get the correct rhythm in your speech. In under 15 minutes, you will be able to start sounding more like a native English speaker. Learn more about speaking naturally in my Clear Accent course.",

    "description": "This lesson will transform your writing by making it richer and more interesting to read. How can you do that, you ask? By using personification, a style of writing which makes an object come to life as if it were a person. Let me explain. If you haven‚Äôt done your homework one night, and it is getting late, you might stare at your school books and feel anger or panic. You could say, ‚ÄúMy evil textbooks were staring at me, laughing‚Äù. Of course, your books are objects that have no emotions, but as a person, you might attribute feelings to objects, and this is what we call personification. The next time you write a story, why not use this technique once or twice, to make the text more engaging? Watch the lesson to find out how to use this technique, with plenty of examples.",

    "description": "Ask questions quickly like a native speaker by learning natural pronunciation. When native speakers of English speak fast, the clear boundaries between words disappear and this is what gives the impression of talking fast. In reality, native speakers are not talking faster than normal‚Äîit‚Äôs just that the sounds in their pronunciation flow together in the most smooth and efficient way. For this natural, flowing effect to happen in pronunciation there are three important changes in pronunciation that may occur. The first change is that whole sounds in the sentence may disappear completely (elision). The second change in pronunciation is that for the sounds to flow more smoothly, individual sounds may shift to a different sound (assimilation). And finally, new sounds that are not in the individual words themselves may appear when the sentence is spoken quickly (intrusion). No need to worry if that makes learning natural pronunciation seem very complicated; I break everything down for you in this lesson. All you need to do is follow the lesson and repeat after me. I‚Äôll also teach you some IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet) so that you can recognise the individual sounds of English more easily. For a lot more information on sounding like a native speaker and improving your accent, take my accent course.",

In this video, I‚Äôll go through many exercises you can do to get your mouth used to making the sounds of English clearly. This will improve your accent, clarity, and make you a better English speaker.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered why we have so many words for the same thing in English? That‚Äôs because we used to speak Anglo-Saxon until the French king William the Conqueror invaded us and brought the French language with him. French never became the language of the peasants and ordinary people; it was only spoken in the court of the king and among the powerful. For this reason, French words in English are more formal than their Anglo-Saxon synonyms. In this lesson, we will look at some English history, and I will give you¬†examples of formal and informal words and where they came from. I am fascinated by the evolution of the English language‚Äîhow it has developed, changed, and adapted over time. Perhaps English is the world‚Äôs number one language for international communication because it always adapts, incorporating new words from different cultures and bringing these into the English language itself.\n\nStriking the right register‚Äîknowing the right word to use in the right situation‚Äîis incredibly important in English. English learners often use vocabulary that is more formal than a native speaker would use, so watch the lesson to learn how to correct this, so you can sound more natural when speaking English.",

    "description": "In this lesson, I will teach you verbs, expressions, and idioms you can use to bring out your unique personality and communication style. For example, there is a lot more you can say other than ‚ÄúI think that‚Ä¶‚Äù Using other expressions such as ‚Äúit looks as if‚Äù, ‚Äúit sounds like‚Äù, ‚ÄúI sense that‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI feel that‚Äù makes your language richer and helps you build relationships with others. Watch this video to discover more about your own personal style and how you can express yourself more like a native speaker. This video goes into the theory of NLP (neuro-linguistic programming). If you want to go even further with the idea of representational systems within NLP, you can then use your knowledge of language and behaviour to build stronger relationships and to influence people. For example, if you observe that your friend is a strongly visual person, you can adapt your language and the expressions you use to be more visual. This will help the two of you connect and interact better.",

That‚Äôs because native speakers do not speak perfectly in natural, everyday speech. In fact, it even sounds strange to say every word perfectly.\n\nI explain to you how we use 'elision' to make our speech more connected, flowing, and relaxed.
