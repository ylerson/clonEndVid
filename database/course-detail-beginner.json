For example, ‚Äúidea‚Äù in Spanish is spelled the same as in English, but it is pronounced differently. The word ‚Äúnecesario‚Äù in Spanish is similar to its English word friend ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù, but notice there are a few letters that are different. Other word friends we will cover in this lesson include calma/calm, decente/decent, honesto/honest, julio/July, necesario/necessary, oliva/olive, and more.

In your native language, it is very likely that the way you move your voice up or down is very different from what is commonly heard in English. Native English speakers can recognize small changes in your voice to understand the meaning behind what you say. Your intonation also determines whether what you say is a statement or a question. There are different kinds of intonations for different kinds of questions. Changing your intonation can also give clues as to how you feel. In this fun lesson, we will play my Banana Game together to learn about intonation! You will learn how you can use your voice to change the meaning of your words.",

Emojis are little images of faces that express emotions in picture form. They are cute and useful for texting friends. But I‚Äôve got news for you. You can‚Äôt use emojis when you are talking! So in this lesson, I will teach you how to use interjections to express your feelings and emotions in English. For example, we use ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù when we want to express surprise, wonder, pleasure, or enthusiasm. We use ‚ÄúOops!‚Äù to express that we‚Äôve made a mistake. And we use ‚ÄúEww!‚Äù to express dislike or disgust. Interjections are powerful because they allow you to express your mood in a single word. You will learn more than 20 common interjections that you can use every day to express yourself, like ‚Äúhuh‚Äù, ‚Äúouch‚Äù, ‚Äúaww‚Äù, ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, ‚Äúyahoo‚Äù, ‚Äúphew‚Äù, and more.

    "description": "Heteronyms are words that are spelled the same way but have different pronunciations and meanings. Since they look the same, it is particularly tricky to know how to pronounce them because you need to be aware of their context. For example, the heteronym close has two different meanings and pronunciations in the following sentences: ‚ÄúWe live close‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose the door.‚Äù In this English lesson, I will teach you many other heteronyms you need to know, like bass, present, refuse, wind, bow, and more. There are no particular rules to determine their pronunciation, and they vary in function, some being verbs, nouns, and adjectives. So watch this lesson to learn some useful English heteronyms, and do the quiz to test your memory.",
